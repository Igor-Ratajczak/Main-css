# Main-css

## Introduction

Main-css is a lightweight CSS library designed to streamline the process of creating web pages. By utilizing simple and intuitive class names, Main-css allows you to easily apply various CSS properties to your HTML elements, eliminating the need for repetitive coding and saving you valuable development time.
## How Does It Work?

With Main-css, applying styles to your elements is as easy as adding a class name. All you need to do is identify the desired CSS property and specify its corresponding value within the class name. For example, if you want to give an element a red, dotted border with a width of 5px, simply add the class **"border-red border-5 border-dotted"** to the element.

While not all colors and sizes are currently available, Main-css provides a wide range of options to choose from. You can find a detailed description of the available colors and sizes in the documentation.

To make it even more convenient, Main-css utilizes shorthand class names for certain properties. For example, instead of using **".position-relative"**, you can simply use **".relative"**. The same applies to the **"display"** property, where **".display-grid"** can be written as **".grid"**.
