# Main-css

## Main css is a CSS library that helps create web pages.
## How does it work?

You only need to know the CSS property and specify its value. For example, if you want an element to have a **red**, **dotted** **border** with a width of **20px**, you can use the class **"border-red border-20 border-dotted"**.
Not all colors and sizes are available yet, but there are several of them (detailed description can be found here).
Some properties are described using shortcuts. For example, instead of using **".position-relative"**, you can use **".relative"**. The same goes for the **"display"** property, where **".display-grid"** can be written as **".grid"**.
